	<aside class="notes">
		Streams is like a conveyor belt. You put something in at the start, it passes through a number of stations that each do one little thing and then finally it lands.

		It's a really nice way of doing things in the build process, because it encourages you to use very small, focused plugins.

	<h1>Vinyl:</h1>
	<h2>File meta data</h2>
	<h2>Path &amp; Content</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		Vinyl is a simple metadata object that describe a file. Gulp primarily uses the filesystem adapter for vinyl, gut could easily use dropbox, s3, ftp or whatever.

		It allows for gulp to use a file abstraction rather than a real file. Though we always use a normal file system.

	<h2>A way to define and run tasks</h2>

		Orchestrator is a way to define and run tasks and dependencies with maximum concurrency.

	<h1>Gulp:</h1>
	<h2>Fast</h2>
	<h2>Code over configuration</h2>
	<aside class="notes">
		So, we have a nice way of modifying objects in small steps. A nice way to describe files as objects and a nice way to define tasks.

		Gulp is fast for two reasons: First, because it works with file meta objects and doesn't need to write to temp files.
		Second, because it runs everything with waximum concurrency.

		You define everything with code.
