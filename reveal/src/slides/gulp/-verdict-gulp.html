	<aside class="notes">
		Gulp is still not very mature. A major api change is announced in Gulp 4 (with new version of Orchestrator). 

		The ecosystem is still not as big as Grunt, a lot of plugins lack functionality or are missing. For example, my favorite style guide generator Sassdown is still grunt only.

		Not that easy to find info.
