		Grunt is a lot better than gulp in most ways. Much better community, more and better plugins etc.

		So why would you use gulp? It's fast, yeah, but why does that matter?

		Imagine drawing something. You have a pen and paper. But you have to flip the paper and wait five seconds before the line that you just drew appears.

		What would that do to your creativity? How different would your end result be? How much different would your thought process be if you had to work with a pen and paper that worked like that?

		That's what coding is like. If you're lucky.

		We're not trying to just make our build process a bit faster. We're trying to enable a different way of thinking about code and the results of the code we write.

		What I want to achieve is a process where we're using code like we use a pencil or a paint brush. To make that happen we need a much closer connection between input and output, between code and program. We want to enable discovery, through code.

		Gulp doesn't acheive that. We're actually not even close to an ideal process. But I think it's the best tool we have at the moment.

		So how have our way of working changed?

		Almost never use dev tools for setting breakpoints or going through or changing code.
