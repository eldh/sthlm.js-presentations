		React is fast. Angular will become faster when object.observe arrives. Ember will get faster when HTMLBars arrives. React is fast now and will continue to get faster as JS engines get faster. So far preformance have been a non-issue for us.

		Organizing your code as reusable, self-contained components makes sense.

		It's surprisingly easy to get into the code. The api is really nice and the concepts are easy to learn. It's easy to write understandable and maintainable code with react. Data flow + virtual DOM is a very clean way of keeping the views in sync. We have very few conversations about "the best way to do things in React".

		Since everything is just vanilla JS it's really easy to test most of the code base. It's even easy to test the code that used to be in your templates.

	<h1>Concerns</h1>
	<h3 class="fragment">- Maturity</h3>
	<h3 class="fragment">- Community</h3>
	<h3 class="fragment">- Testing</h3>
	<aside class="notes">
		React is still evolving quickly, a lot of stuff is still improving, and it's still not 1.0. Though the api is relatively stable. 

		The community is still small, but growing.

		Testing tools are getting better, but! Unit testing components is a bit of a hassle. You have to use JSDOM, and it's buggy. Integration tests with phantom or selenium comes to the rescue.

		In total, I really like React and I think our setup is working surprisingly well.
